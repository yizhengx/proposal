abstract = {Current debugging and optimization methods scale poorly to deal with the complexity of modern Internet services, in which a single request triggers parallel execution of numerous heterogeneous software components over a distributed set of computers. The Achilles' heel of current methods is the need for a complete and accurate model of the system under observation: producing such a model is challenging because it requires either assimilating the collective knowledge of hundreds of programmers responsible for the individual components or restricting the ways in which components interact.Fortunately, the scale of modern Internet services offers a compensating benefit: the sheer volume of requests serviced means that, even at low sampling rates, one can gather a tremendous amount of empirical performance observations and apply "big data" techniques to analyze those observations. In this paper, we show how one can automatically construct a model of request execution from pre-existing component logs by generating a large number of potential hypotheses about program behavior and rejecting hypotheses contradicted by the empirical observations. We also show how one can validate potential performance improvements without costly implementation effort by leveraging the variation in component behavior that arises naturally over large numbers of requests to measure the impact of optimizing individual components or changing scheduling behavior.We validate our methodology by analyzing performance traces of over 1.3 million requests to Facebook servers. We present a detailed study of the factors that affect the end-to-end latency of such requests. We also use our methodology to suggest and validate a scheduling optimization for improving Facebook request latency.},

Canopy records causally related performance data across the end-to-end execution path of requests, including from browsers, mobile applications, and backend services. Canopy processes traces in near real-time, derives user-specified features, and outputs to performance datasets that aggregate across billions of requests. Using Canopy, Facebook engineers can query and analyze performance data in real-time. Canopy addresses three challenges we have encountered in scaling performance analysis: supporting the range of execution and performance models used by different components of the Facebook stack; supporting interactive ad-hoc analysis of performance data; and enabling deep customization by users, from sampling traces to extracting and visualizing features. Canopy currently records and processes over 1 billion traces per day. We discuss how Canopy has evolved to apply to a wide range of scenarios, and present case studies of its use in solving various performance challenges.},

We measure the overhead of 3MileBeach as a tracer and its efficacy as a fault injector. We qualitatively measure its promise as a platform for tuning and debugging by sharing concrete use cases in the context of bottleneck identification, performance tuning, and bug finding. Finally, we use 3MileBeach to perform a novel type of fault injection - Temporal Fault Injection (TFI), which more precisely controls individual inter-service message flow with temporal prerequisites, and makes it possible to catch an entirely new class of fault tolerance bugs.},

abstract = {At global user population scale, important microservices in warehouse-scale data centers can grow to account for an enormous installed base of servers. With the end of Dennard scaling, successive server generations running these microservices exhibit diminishing performance returns. Hence, it is imperative to understand how important microservices spend their CPU cycles to determine acceleration opportunities across the global server fleet. To this end, we first undertake a comprehensive characterization of the top seven microservices that run on the compute-optimized data center fleet at Facebook.Our characterization reveals that microservices spend as few as 18\% of CPU cycles executing core application logic (e.g., performing a key-value store); the remaining cycles are spent in common operations that are not core to the application logic (e.g., I/O processing, logging, and compression). Accelerating such common building blocks can greatly improve data center performance. Whereas developing specialized hardware acceleration for each building block might be beneficial, it becomes risky at scale if these accelerators do not yield expected gains due to performance bounds precipitated by offload-induced overheads. To identify such performance bounds early in the hardware design phase, we develop an analytical model, Accelerometer, for hardware acceleration that projects realistic speedup in microservices. We validate Accelerometer's utility in production using three retrospective case studies and demonstrate how it estimates the real speedup with ≤ 3.7\% error. We then use Accelerometer to project gains from accelerating important common building blocks identified by our characterization.},

abstract = {A common approach to improving resource utilization in data centers is to adaptively provision resources based on the actual workload. One fundamental challenge of doing this in microservice management frameworks, however, is that different components of a service can exhibit significant differences in their impact on end-to-end performance. To make resource management more challenging, a single microservice can be shared by multiple online services that have diverse workload patterns and SLA requirements. We present an efficient resource management system, namely Erms, for guaranteeing SLAs in shared microservice environments. Erms profiles microservice latency as a piece-wise linear function of the workload, resource usage, and interference. Based on this profiling, Erms builds resource scaling models to optimally determine latency targets for microservices with complex dependencies. Erms also designs new scheduling policies at shared microservices to further enhance resource efficiency. Experiments across microservice benchmarks as well as trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Erms can reduce SLA violation probability by 5\texttimes{} and more importantly, lead to a reduction in resource usage by 1.6\texttimes{}, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Cloud applications are increasingly shifting from large monolithic services, to large numbers of loosely-coupled, specialized microservices. Despite their advantages in terms of facilitating development, deployment, modularity, and isolation, microservices complicate resource management, as dependencies between them introduce backpressure effects and cascading QoS violations. We present Sinan, a data-driven cluster manager for interactive cloud microservices that is online and QoS-aware. Sinan leverages a set of scalable and validated machine learning models to determine the performance impact of dependencies between microservices, and allocate appropriate resources per tier in a way that preserves the end-to-end tail latency target. We evaluate Sinan both on dedicated local clusters and large-scale deployments on Google Compute Engine (GCE) across representative end-to-end applications built with microservices, such as social networks and hotel reservation sites. We show that Sinan always meets QoS, while also maintaining cluster utilization high, in contrast to prior work which leads to unpredictable performance or sacrifices resource efficiency. Furthermore, the techniques in Sinan are explainable, meaning that cloud operators can yield insights from the ML models on how to better deploy and design their applications to reduce unpredictable performance.},

abstract = {As modern cloud services have scaled out, applications have moved from relatively monolithic designs to highly modularized fleets of microservices that communicate among each other to perform application-level tasks. These microservices effectively form a network at the application layer, and service mesh frameworks have recently emerged to factor out microservices' common communication functionality.This paper seeks to highlight the emergence of service meshes as what is effectively a new layer in the networking stack, and the associated new challenges and opportunities. As a case study, we leverage the fact that service meshes can be better informed about application needs, and design a system that utilizes provenance tracing within the service mesh to perform cross-layer prioritization of latency-sensitive requests, within an application serving a mix of workloads. Broadly speaking, we believe that as applications factor out communication into service meshes, an exciting new domain is opening that can utilize techniques from the networking community to improve application performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to diagnosing problems in complex distributed systems. Our approach is based on the insight that many of the trickiest problems are anomalies. For instance, in a network, problems often affect only a small fraction of the traffic (e.g., perhaps a certain subnet), or they only manifest infrequently. Thus, it is quite common for the operator to have “examples” of both working and non-working traffic readily available – perhaps a packet that was misrouted, and a similar packet that was routed correctly. In this case, the cause of the problem is likely to be wherever the two packets were treated differently by the network.We present the design of a debugger that can leverage this information using a novel concept that we call differential provenance. Differential provenance tracks the causal connections between network states and state changes, just like classical provenance, but it can additionally perform root-cause analysis by reasoning about the differences between two provenance trees. We have built a diagnostic tool that is based on differential provenance, and we have used our tool to debug a number of complex, realistic problems in two scenarios: software-defined networks and MapReduce jobs. Our results show that differential provenance can be maintained at relatively low cost, and that it can deliver very precise diagnostic information; in many cases, it can even identify the precise root cause of the problem.},

abstract = {Improving performance is a central concern for software developers. To locate optimization opportunities, developers rely on software profilers. However, these profilers only report where programs spent their time: optimizing that code may have no impact on performance. Past profilers thus both waste developer time and make it difficult for them to uncover significant optimization opportunities.This paper introduces causal profiling. Unlike past profiling approaches, causal profiling indicates exactly where programmers should focus their optimization efforts, and quantifies their potential impact. Causal profiling works by running performance experiments during program execution. Each experiment calculates the impact of any potential optimization by virtually speeding up code: inserting pauses that slow down all other code running concurrently. The key insight is that this slowdown has the same relative effect as running that line faster, thus "virtually" speeding it up.We present Coz, a causal profiler, which we evaluate on a range of highly-tuned applications: Memcached, SQLite, and the PARSEC benchmark suite. Coz identifies previously unknown optimization opportunities that are both significant and targeted. Guided by Coz, we improve the performance of Memcached by 9\%, SQLite by 25\%, and accelerate six PARSEC applications by as much as 68\%; in most cases, these optimizations involve modifying under 10 lines of code.},

abstract = {Causal profiling is a novel and powerful profiling technique that quantifies the potential impact of optimizing a code segment on the program runtime. A key application of causal profiling is to analyze what-if scenarios which typically require a large number of experiments. Besides, the execution of a program highly depends on the underlying machine resources, e.g., CPU, network, storage, so profiling results on one device does not translate directly to another. This is a major bottleneck in our ability to perform scalable performance analysis and greatly limits cross-platform software development.In this paper, we address the above challenges by leveraging a unique property of causal profiling: only relative performance of different resources affects the result of causal profiling, not their absolute performance. We first analytically model and prove causal profiling, the missing piece in the seminal paper. Then, we assert the necessary condition to achieve virtual causal profiling on a secondary device. Building upon the theory, we design VCoz, a virtual causal profiler that enables profiling applications on target devices using measurements on the host device. We implement a prototype of VCoz by tuning multiple hardware components to preserve the relative execution speeds of code segments. Our experiments on benchmarks that stress different system resources demonstrate that VCoz can generate causal profiling reports of Nexus 6P (an ARM-based device) on a host MacBook (x86 architecture) with less than 16\% variance.},

the Join Order Benchmark (JOB) and experimentally revisit the main components in the
classic query optimizer architecture using a complex, real-world data set and realistic
multi-join queries. We investigate the quality of industrial-strength cardinality
estimators and find that all estimators routinely produce large errors. We further
show that while estimates are essential for finding a good join order, query performance
is unsatisfactory if the query engine relies too heavily on these estimates. Using
another set of experiments that measure the impact of the cost model, we find that
it has much less influence on query performance than the cardinality estimates. Finally,
we investigate plan enumeration techniques comparing exhaustive dynamic programming
with heuristic algorithms and find that exhaustive enumeration improves performance
despite the sub-optimal cardinality estimates.},

We then apply it to Mylar, a framework that uses multi-key searchable encryption (MKSE) to build Web applications on top of encrypted data.We demonstrate that (1) the Popa-Zeldovich model for MKSE does not imply security against either passive or active attacks; (2) Mylar-based Web applications reveal users' data and queries to passive and active adversarial servers; and (3) Mylar is generically insecure against active attacks due to system design flaws. Our results show that the problem of securing client-server applications against actively malicious servers is challenging and still unsolved.We conclude with general lessons for the designers of systems that rely on property-preserving or searchable encryption to protect data from untrusted servers.},

abstract = {Searching on remote encrypted data (commonly known as searchable encryption) has become an important issue in secure data outsourcing, since it allows users to outsource encrypted data to an untrusted third party while maintains the capability of keyword search on the data. Searchable encryption can be achieved using the classical method called oblivious RAM, but the resultant schemes are too inefficient to be applied in the real-world scenarios (e.g., cloud computing). Recently, a number of efficient searchable encryption schemes have been proposed under weaker security guarantees. Such schemes, however, still leak statistical information about the users' search pattern. In this paper, we first present two concrete attack methods to show that the search pattern leakage will result in such a situation: an adversary who has some auxiliary knowledge can uncover the underlying keywords of user queries. To address this issue, we then develop a grouping-based construction (GBC) to transform an existing searchable encryption scheme to a new scheme hiding the search pattern. Finally, experiments based on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack methods and the feasibility of our construction.},

abstract = {Schemes for secure outsourcing of client data with search capability are being increasingly marketed and deployed. In the literature, schemes for accomplishing this efficiently are called Searchable Encryption (SE). They achieve high efficiency with provable security by means of a quantifiable leakage profile. However, the degree to which SE leakage can be exploited by an adversary is not well understood.To address this, we present a characterization of the leakage profiles of in-the-wild searchable encryption products and SE schemes in the literature, and present attack models based on an adversarial server's prior knowledge. Then we empirically investigate the security of searchable encryption by providing query recovery and plaintext recovery attacks that exploit these leakage profiles. We term these leakage-abuse attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness for varying leakage profiles and levels of server knowledge, for realistic scenarios. Amongst our contributions are realistic active attacks which have not been previously explored.},

abstract = {From the Publisher:Database Management Systems (DBMS) is a must for any course in database systems or file organization. DBMS provides a hands-on approach to relational database systems, with an emphasis on practical topics such as indexing methods, SQL, and database design. New to this edition are the early coverage of the ER model, new chapters on Internet databases, data mining, and spatial databases, and a new supplement on practical SQL assignments (with solutions for instructors' use). Many other chapters have been reorganized or expanded to provide up-to-date coverage.}

However, many practical proposals rely on a set of weak encryption schemes that have been shown to leak sensitive data. In this paper, we propose Arx, a practical and functionally rich database system that encrypts the data only with semantically secure encryption schemes.

There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the problem as a whole has not received the theoretical treatment it deserves. In this paper, we make the first steps towards a theoretic treatment of software protection: First, we distill and formulate the key problem of learning about a program from its execution. Second, assuming the existence of one-way permutations, we present an efficient way of executing programs such that it is infeasible to learn anything about the program by monitoring its executions.How can one efficiently execute programs without allowing an adversary, monitoring the execution, to learn anything about the program? Traditional cryptographic techniques can be applied to keep the contents of the memory unknown throughout the execution, but are not applicable to the problem of hiding the access pattern. The problem of hiding the access pattern efficiently corresponds to efficient simulation of Random Access Machines (RAM) on an oblivious RAM. We define an oblivious RAM to be a (probabilistic) RAM for which (the distribution of) the memory access pattern is independent of the input. We present an (on-line) simulation of t steps of an arbitrary RAM with m memory cells, by less than t·mε steps of an oblivious RAM with 2m memory cells, where ε&gt;0 is an arbitrary constant.},

There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the problem as a whole has not received the theoretical treatment it deserves. In this paper, we provide theoretical treatment of software protection. We reduce the problem of software protection to the problem of efficient simulation on oblivious RAM.A machine is oblivious if thhe sequence in which it accesses memory locations is equivalent for any two inputs with the same running time. For example, an oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement of the heads on the tapes is identical for each computation. (Thus, the movement is independent of the actual input.) What is the slowdown in the running time of a machine, if it is required to be oblivious? In 1979, Pippenger and Fischer showed how a two-tape oblivious Turing Machine can simulate, on-line, a one-tape Turing Machine, with a logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show an analogous result for the random-access machine (RAM) model of computation. In particular, we show how to do an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM by a probabilistic oblivious RAM with a polylogaithmic slowdown in the running time. On the other hand, we show that a logarithmic slowdown is a lower bound.},

abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},

abstract = {We present a secure network service for sovereign information sharing whose only trusted component is an off-theshelf secure coprocessor. The participating data providers send encrypted relations to the service that sends the encrypted results to the recipients. The technical challenge in implementing such a service arises from the limited capability of the secure coprocessors: they have small memory, no attached disk, and no facility for communicating directly with other machines in the network. The internal state of an ongoing computation within the secure coprocessor cannot be seen from outside, but its interactions with the server can be exploited by an adversary. We formulate the problem of computing join in this setting where the goal is to prevent information leakage through patterns in I/O while maximizing performance. We specify criteria for proving the security of a join algorithm and provide provably safe algorithms. These algorithms can be used to compute general joins involving arbitrary predicates and multiple sovereign databases. We thus enable a new class of applications requiring query processing across sovereign entities such that nothing apart from the result is revealed to the recipients.},

Our FHE scheme is an NTRU-like cryptosystem, with additional support for efficient key switching and modulus reduction operations to reduce the frequency of bootstrapping operations. Ciphertexts in our scheme are represented as matrices of 64-bit integers. The basis of our design is a layered software services stack to provide high-level FHE operations supported by lower-level lattice-based primitive implementations running on a computing substrate. We implement and evaluate our FHE scheme to run on a commodity CPU-based computing environment. We implemented our FHE scheme to run in a compiled C environment and use parallelism to take advantage of multi-core processors. We provide experimental results which show that our FHE implementation provides at least an order of magnitude improvement in runtime as compared to recent publicly known evaluation results of other FHE software implementations.",

Legacy applications continue to run on the untrusted operating system, while a small hyper visor or trusted hardware prevents the operating system from accessing the applications' memory. In this paper, we introduce controlled-channel attacks, a new type of side-channel attack that allows an untrusted operating system to extract large amounts of sensitive information from protected applications on systems like Overshadow, Ink Tag or Haven. We implement the attacks on Haven and Ink Tag and demonstrate their power by extracting complete text documents and outlines of JPEG images from widely deployed application libraries. Given these attacks, it is unclear if Over shadow's vision of protecting unmodified legacy applications from legacy operating systems running on off-the-shelf hardware is still tenable.},

abstract = {Side-channel risks of Intel SGX have recently attracted great attention. Under the spotlight is the newly discovered page-fault attack, in which an OS-level adversary induces page faults to observe the page-level access patterns of a protected process running in an SGX enclave. With almost all proposed defense focusing on this attack, little is known about whether such efforts indeed raise the bar for the adversary, whether a simple variation of the attack renders all protection ineffective, not to mention an in-depth understanding of other attack surfaces in the SGX system. In the paper, we report the first step toward systematic analyses of side-channel threats that SGX faces, focusing on the risks associated with its memory management. Our research identifies 8 potential attack vectors, ranging from TLB to DRAM modules. More importantly, we highlight the common misunderstandings about SGX memory side channels, demonstrating that high frequent AEXs can be avoided when recovering EdDSA secret key through a new page channel and fine-grained monitoring of enclave programs (at the level of 64B) can be done through combining both cache and cross-enclave DRAM channels. Our findings reveal the gap between the ongoing security research on SGX and its side-channel weaknesses, redefine the side-channel threat model for secure enclaves, and can provoke a discussion on when to use such a system and how to use it securely.},

abstract = {For the first time, we practically demonstrate that Intel SGX enclaves are vulnerable against cache-timing attacks. As a case study, we present an access-driven cache-timing attack on AES when running inside an Intel SGX enclave. Using Neve and Seifert's elimination method, as well as a cache probing mechanism relying on Intel PMC, we are able to extract the AES secret key in less than 10 seconds by investigating 480 encrypted blocks on average. The AES implementation we attack is based on a Gladman AES implementation taken from an older version of OpenSSL, which is known to be vulnerable to cache-timing attacks. In contrast to previous works on cache-timing attacks, our attack is executed with root privileges running on the same host as the vulnerable enclave. Intel SGX, however, was designed to precisely protect applications against such root-level attacks. As a consequence, we show that SGX cannot withstand its designated attacker model when it comes to side-channel vulnerabilities. To the contrary, the attack surface for side-channels increases dramatically in the scenario of SGX due to the power of root-level attackers, for example, by exploiting the accuracy of PMC, which is restricted to kernel code.},

abstract = {For Web applications in which the database component is the bottleneck, scalability can be provided by a third-party Database Scalability Service Provider (DSSP) that caches application data and supplies query answers on behalf of the application. Cost-effective DSSPs will need to cache data from many applications, inevitably raising concerns about security. However, if all data passing through a DSSP is encrypted to enhance security, then data updates trigger invalidation of large regions of cache. Consequently, achieving good scalability becomes virtually impossible. There is a tradeoff between security and scalability, which requires careful consideration.In this paper we study the security-scalability tradeoff, both formally and empirically. We begin by providing a method for statically identifying segments of the database that can be encrypted without impacting scalability. Experiments over a prototype DSSP system show the effectiveness of our static analysis method--for all three realistic bench-mark applications that we study, our method enables a significant fraction of the database to be encrypted without impacting scalability. Moreover, most of the data that can be encrypted without impacting scalability is of the type that application designers will want to encrypt, all other things being equal. Based on our static analysis method, we propose a new scalability-conscious security design methodology that features: (a) compulsory encryption of highly sensitive data like credit card information, and (b) encryption of data for which encryption does not impair scalability. As a result, the security-scalability tradeoff needs to be considered only over data for which encryption impacts scalability, thus greatly simplifying the task of managing the tradeoff.},

Previous approaches to enabling such a service have been based on data encryption, causing a large overhead in query processing. We propose a new, distributed architecture that allows an organization to outsource its data management to {\em two} untrusted servers while preserving data privacy. We show how the presence of two servers enables efficient partitioning of data so that the contents at any one server are guaranteed not to breach data privacy. We show how to optimize and execute queries in this architecture, and discuss new challenges that emerge in designing the database schema.}

abstract = {Many online services let users query public datasets such as maps, flight prices, or restaurant reviews. Unfortunately, the queries to these services reveal highly sensitive information that can compromise users' privacy. This paper presents Splinter, a system that protects users' queries on public data and scales to realistic applications. A user splits her query into multiple parts and sends each part to a different provider that holds a copy of the data. As long as any one of the providers is honest and does not collude with the others, the providers cannot determine the query. Splinter uses and extends a new cryptographic primitive called Function Secret Sharing (FSS) that makes it up to an order of magnitude more efficient than prior systems based on Private Information Retrieval and garbled circuits. We develop protocols extending FSS to new types of queries, such as MAX and TOPK queries. We also provide an optimized implementation of FSS using AES-NI instructions and multicores. Splinter achieves end-to-end latencies below 1.6 seconds for realistic workloads including a Yelp clone, flight search, and map routing.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of Obladi, the first system to provide ACID transactions while also hiding access patterns. Obladi uses as its building block oblivious RAM, but turns the demands of supporting transactions into a performance opportunity. By executing transactions within epochs and delaying commit decisions until an epoch ends, Obladi reduces the amortized bandwidth costs of oblivious storage and increases overall system throughput. These performance gains, combined with new oblivious mechanisms for concurrency control and recovery, allow Obladi to execute OLTP workloads with reasonable throughput: it comes within 5\texttimes{} to 12\texttimes{} of a non-oblivious baseline on the TPC-C, SmallBank, and FreeHealth applications. Latency overheads, however, are higher (70\texttimes{} on TPC-C).},

abstract = {Encryption is a well established technology for protecting sensitive data. However, once encrypted, data can no longer be easily queried aside from exact matches. We present an order-preserving encryption scheme for numeric data that allows any comparison operation to be directly applied on encrypted data. Query results produced are sound (no false hits) and complete (no false drops). Our scheme handles updates gracefully and new values can be added without requiring changes in the encryption of other values. It allows standard databse indexes to be built over encrypted tables and can easily be integrated with existing database systems. The proposed scheme has been designed to be deployed in application environments in which the intruder can get access to the encrypted database, but does not have prior domain information such as the distribution of values and annot encrypt or decrypt arbitrary values of his choice. The encryption is robust against estimation of the true value in such environments.},

abstract = {Recently, various protocols have been proposed for securely outsourcing database storage to a third party server, ranging from systems with "full-fledged" security based on strong cryptographic primitives such as fully homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM, to more practical implementations based on searchable symmetric encryption or even on deterministic and order-preserving encryption. On the flip side, various attacks have emerged that show that for some of these protocols confidentiality of the data can be compromised, usually given certain auxiliary information. We take a step back and identify a need for a formal understanding of the inherent efficiency/privacy trade-off in outsourced database systems, independent of the details of the system. We propose abstract models that capture secure outsourced storage systems in sufficient generality, and identify two basic sources of leakage, namely access pattern and ommunication volume. We use our models to distinguish certain classes of outsourced database systems that have been proposed, and deduce that all of them exhibit at least one of these leakage sources.We then develop generic reconstruction attacks on any system supporting range queries where either access pattern or communication volume is leaked. These attacks are in a rather weak passive adversarial model, where the untrusted server knows only the underlying query distribution. In particular, to perform our attack the server need not have any prior knowledge about the data, and need not know any of the issued queries nor their results. Yet, the server can reconstruct the secret attribute of every record in the database after about $N^4$ queries, where N is the domain size. We provide a matching lower bound showing that our attacks are essentially optimal. Our reconstruction attacks using communication volume apply even to systems based on homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM in the natural way.Finally, we provide experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our attacks on real datasets with a variety of different features. On all these datasets, after the required number of queries our attacks successfully recovered the secret attributes of every record in at most a few seconds.},

abstract = {Machine learning is widely used to produce models for a range of applications and is increasingly offered as a service by major technology companies. However, the required massive data collection raises privacy concerns during both training and prediction stages. In this paper, we design and implement a general framework for privacy-preserving machine learning and use it to obtain new solutions for training linear regression, logistic regression and neural network models. Our protocols are in a three-server model wherein data owners secret share their data among three servers who train and evaluate models on the joint data using three-party computation (3PC). Our main contribution is a new and complete framework ($textABY ^3$) for efficiently switching back and forth between arithmetic, binary, and Yao 3PC which is of independent interest. Many of the conversions are based on new techniques that are designed and optimized for the first time in this paper. We also propose new techniques for fixed-point multiplication of shared decimal values that extends beyond the three-party case, and customized protocols for evaluating piecewise polynomial functions. We design variants of each building block that is secure against em malicious adversaries who deviate arbitrarily. We implement our system in C++. Our protocols are up to em four orders of magnitude faster than the best prior work, hence significantly reducing the gap between privacy-preserving and plaintext training.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new tool for controlling the knowledge transfer process in cryptographic protocol design. It is applied to solve a general class of problems which include most of the two-party cryptographic problems in the literature. Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = pundefinedq such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A. All these results are proved assuming only that the problem of factoring large intergers is computationally intractable.},
